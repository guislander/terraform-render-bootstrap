  # Identity allocation mode selects how identities are shared between cilium
  # nodes by setting how they are stored. The options are "crd" or "kvstore".
  # - "crd" stores identities in kubernetes as CRDs (custom resource definition).
  #   These can be queried with:
  #     kubectl get ciliumid
  # - "kvstore" stores identities in a kvstore, etcd or consul, that is
  #   configured below. Cilium versions before 1.6 supported only the kvstore
  #   backend. Upgrades from these older cilium versions should continue using
  #   the kvstore by commenting out the identity-allocation-mode below, or
  #   setting it to "kvstore".
  identity-allocation-mode: crd

  # identity-change-grace-period is the grace period that needs to pass
  # before an endpoint that has changed its identity will start using
  # that new identity. During the grace period, the new identity has
  # already been allocated and other nodes in the cluster have a chance
  # to whitelist the new upcoming identity of the endpoint.

  # If you want cilium monitor to aggregate tracing for packets, set this level

  # Pre-allocation of map entries allows per-packet latency to be reduced, at
  # the expense of up-front memory allocation for the entries in the maps. The

  # If this value is modified, then during the next Cilium startup the restore
  # of existing endpoints and tracking of ongoing connections may be disrupted.
  # As a result, reply packets may be dropped and the load-balancing decisions
  # for established connections may change.
